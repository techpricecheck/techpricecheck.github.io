<h2>Q: Did you use AI to make this website?</h2>
<p>A: Partially. While I came up with the idea to price compare a wide variety of laptops, Google Gemini suggested crowdsourcing as an alternative to web scraping price data. The logo and name were also made by Google Gemini while the core site design is mine.</p>
<p>Additionally, about 10 lines of code in style.css is AI-generated. And Google Gemini (again) gave tips while I was making the homepage to make it look more professional by changing the font and color scheme.</p>
