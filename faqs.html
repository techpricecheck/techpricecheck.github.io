<h2>Q: Did you use AI to make this website?</h2>
<p>A: Partially. While I came up with the idea to price compare a wide variety of things, Google Gemini suggested crowdsourcing as an alternative to web scraping price data. The logo and name were also made by Google Gemini while the core site design is mine.</p>
<p>Additionally, about 10 lines of code in style.css is AI-generated.</p>
